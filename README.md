# UX410-Opencore-Ventura

My ASUS UX410 Opencore EFI Repo for Ventura

Remember to add your SystemSerialNumber, MLB, UUID and ROM in config.plist

Thanks for the hieplpvip's & xick's excellent works. I installed macos Ventura on Ux410 successfully. 
At beginning, the display can not be recognized and has maximum back light. I change AAPL and device-id to 1659 from 1619, then it works well.

The number 1659 is refered from this https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/blob/master/Manual/FAQ.IntelHD.en.md

and special thanks for hieplpvip & xick
